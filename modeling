Modeling the spread

Modeling is being carried out based on the variogram, which is used as a metic to to detect on how spatial data are related as a prerequisite for prediction in combination with kriging method. The latter is used, in turn, as an interpolation procedure based on the degree of this dependency. By analogy the process can be considered as that of a Bayesian approach defining a prior distribution function that is used to generate the a posteriori predictions. Kriging is also known as a spatial prediction methodology in the context of spatio-temporal data.

The Variogram 
The variogram information is thus generated from sets of these neighboring geographical locations that are correlated together or dependent on each other. If the geographical positions are correlated in space, the difference between two random associated variables Z(si) and Z(si+h) is expressed as a function of geographical distance h between the two geographical positions as follows:
 
The variogram is expressed as the expected value of the squared difference between the two variables Z(si) and Z(si+h), separated by a distance h (Cressie 1993), Where h is the lag, which can be here the Euclidean distance between any two geographical locations.
A typical variogram represents the spatial behavior that can be detected from it as the constant (c0), called the nugget variance, the range or distance (ae), beyond which the geographical positions or stations are independent, and the sill (ce), the maximum value reached at the distance (ae). Here we used the Exponential variogram model.
  
The exponential model occurs when changes in boundaries are a major source of variation.
The semi-variance could also be called the variance of increments because it is the result of the variance of the difference between the random variables Z(i) and Z(i+h)=Z(j). When it is plotted against h, the graph is called the semi-variogram or variogram for short, which is calculated in practice from samples gathered through a spatial/temporal process (Cressie 1993).

A variogram represents the spatial behavior that can be detected from:
-	the constant (c0), called the nugget variance; it represents location to variability between adjacent pixels; 
-	The range  (a), beyond which pixel values are independent; it gives information on spatial dependence between the pixel locations; 
-	The sill (c), which is the maximum value reached at the distance/range (a); it gives information on the total amount of variability. 

There are several types of theoretical variograms to which an observed variogram might be fit. The basic models are the linear, spherical, exponential, and power model.

Linear model
 
The linear model has no sill: as the distances increase the diversity varies increasingly. This is likely to result because there is an inadequate number of samples or there is an abrupt cut-off in the sampled area (border). 

Spherical variogram model

The spherical variogram is used commonly because most data (geological) fit this type of model well.  

Exponential model 
 
The exponential model occurs when changes in boundaries are a major source of variation.

Power model

The power variogram is similar to the linear model. It is an unbounded variogram where a property such as diversity may vary increasingly. This type of variation also matches Brownian motion.

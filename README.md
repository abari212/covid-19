Tracking to curb the virus spread

The repository contains both codes and data to help to track and curb the virus spread

Tracking is another effective measure to curb the spread of covid-19, in addition to physical distancing. This is a simple animation that I have been working using R, of which a script is available at my GitHub. The same script can be used at a much more granular scale, such as a city.

The spread output can be layered on top other data-sets to find out what variables are likely to help in the prediction of the spread.

Both scripts and data-sets are shared at GitHub for any one to use to help to stop the spread in consultation with authorities.

The data used consists of two sets, one on the virus incidence and one on the geo-location information. The data on the incidence was extracted from WHO daily reports and the data on the location from Google.
